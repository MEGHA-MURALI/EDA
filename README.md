Project Brief 
You work for Teclov, an asset management company. Teclov wants to make 
investments in a few companies. The CEO of Teclov wants to understand the global 
trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively. 
 
Business and Data Understanding 
Teclov has two minor constraints for investments: 
1. It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
2. It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of 
communication with the companies it would invest in
! For your analysis, consider a country to be English speaking only if English is 
one of the official languages in that country
! You may use this list: Click here for a list of countries where English is an 
official language.
 
These conditions will give you sufficient information for your initial analysis. Before 
getting to specific questions, let’s understand the problem and the data first. 
 
1. What is the strategy? 
Teclov wants to invest where most other investors are investing. This pattern is 
often observed among early stage startup investors. 
 2. Where did we get the data from? 
We have taken real investment data from crunchbase.com, so the insights you get 
may be incredibly useful. For this group project, we have divided the data into the 
following files: 
 
You have to use three main data tables for the entire analysis 
 
3. What is Teclov’ business objective? 
The business objectives and goals of data analysis are pretty straightforward. 
1. Business objective: The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, 
and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is 
to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and 
countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'.
2. Goals of data analysis: Your goals are divided into three sub-goals:
○ Investment type analysis: Comparing the typical investment amounts 
in the venture, seed, angel, private equity etc. so that Teclov can 
choose the type that is best suited for their strategy.
○ Country analysis: Identifying the countries which have been the most 
heavily invested in the past. These will be Teclov’ favourites as well.
○ Sector analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across 
the eight main sectors. (Note that we are interested in the eight 'main 
sectors' provided in the mapping file. The two files — companies and rounds2 — have numerous sub-sector names; hence, you will need to 
map each sub-sector to its main sector.)
1. Company details 
companies: A table with basic data of companies 
3. Sector Classification: 
mapping.csv: This file maps the numerous category names in the companies table 
(such 3D printing, aerospace, agriculture, etc.) to eight broad sector names. The 
purpose is to simplify the analysis into eight sector buckets, rather than trying to 
analyse hundreds of them. 
Problem 1: Data Cleaning 1 
1. Load the companies and rounds data into two data frames and name them
companies and rounds2 respectively.
2. Table 1.1:
 
Results Expected: Table 1.1 
Table 1.1: Understand the Data Set 
How many unique companies are present in rounds2?
How many unique companies are present in companies?  
After this, you will need to work only with the master frame. 
 
Problem 2: Funding Type Analysis 
This is the first of the three goals of data analysis – investment type analysis. 
 
The funding types such as seed, venture, angel, etc. depend on the type of the 
company (startup, corporate, etc.), its stage (early stage startup, funded startup, 
etc.), the amount of funding (a few million USD to a billion USD), and so on. For 
example, seed, angel and venture are three common stages of startup funding. 
! Seed/angel funding refer to early stage startups whereas venture funding 
occurs after seed or angel stage/s and involves a relatively higher amount of 
investment.
! Private equity type investments are associated with much larger companies 
and involve much higher investments than venture type. Startups which have 
In the companies data frame, which column can be used as the unique 
key for each company? Write the name of the column.
Are there any companies in the rounds2 file which are not present in 
companies? Answer yes or no: Y/N
Merge the two data frames so that all variables (columns) in the 
companies frame are added to the rounds2 data frame. Name the 
merged frame master_frame. How many observations are present in 
master_frame?grown in scale may also receive private equity funding. This means that if a 
company has reached the venture stage, it would have already passed 
through the angel or seed stage/s.
 
Teclov wants to choose one of these four investment types for each potential 
investment they will make. 
 
Considering the constraints of Teclov, you have to decide one funding type which is 
most suitable for them. 
1. Calculate the most representative value of the investment amount for 
each of the four funding types (venture, angel, seed, and private equity) and 
report the answers in the template provided on the previous page
2. Based on the most representative investment amount calculated above, which 
investment type do you think is the most suitable for Teclov?
 
Considering that Teclov wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per investment 
round, which investment type is the most suitable for it? Identify the investment type 
and, for further analysis, filter the data so it only contains the chosen investment 
type. 
Problems - Part 2 
Problem 3: Country Analysis 
This is the second goal of analysis — country analysis.  
Now that you know the type of investment suited for Teclov, let's narrow down the 
countries. 
 
Teclov wants to invest in countries with the highest amount of funding for the chosen 
investment type. This is a part of its broader strategy to invest where most 
investments are occurring. 
 
1. Teclov wants to see the top nine countries which have received the highest 
total funding (across ALL sectors for the chosen investment type)
2. For the chosen investment type, make a data frame named top9 with the top 
nine countries (based on the total investment amount each country has 
received)
 
Identify the top three English-speaking countries in the data frame top9. 
 
Results Expected: All codes for data frame top9. Fill out Table 3.1. 
 
Table 3.1: Analysing the Top 3 English-Speaking Countries  
Now you also know the three most investment-friendly countries and the most suited 
funding type for Teclov. Let us now focus on finding the best sectors in these 
countries. 
 
Problem 4: Sector Analysis 1 
This is the third goal of analysis — sector analysis. 
 
When we say sector analysis, we refer to one of the eight main sectors listed in the 
mapping file (note that ‘Other’ is one of the eight main sectors; also, there are eight 
sectors if you consider the category 'Blanks' as a missing value). This is to simplify 
the analysis by grouping the numerous category lists (named ‘category_list’) in the 
mapping file. For example, in the mapping file, category_lists such as ‘3D’, ‘3D 
Printing’, ‘3D Technology’, etc. are mapped to the main sector ‘Manufacturing’. 
 
 1. Top English-speaking country 
 2. Second English-speaking 
country
 3. Third English-speaking 
countryAlso, for some companies, the category list is a list of multiple sub-sectors separated 
by a pipe (vertical bar |). For example, one of the companies’ category_list is 
Application Platforms|Real Time|Social Network Media. 
 
You discuss with the CEO and come up with the business rule that the first string 
before the vertical bar will be considered the primary sector. In the example above, 
‘Application Platforms’ will be considered the primary sector. 
1. Extract the primary sector of each category list from the category_list 
column
2. Use the mapping file 'mapping.csv' to map each primary sector to one of the 
eight main sectors (Note that ‘Others’ is also considered one of the main 
sectors)
Expected Results: Code for a merged data frame with each primary sector mapped 
to its main sector (the primary sector should be present in a separate column). 
 
Problem 5: Sector Analysis 2 
Now you have a data frame with each company’s main sector (main_sector) mapped 
to it. When we say sector analysis, we refer to one of the eight main sectors. 
 Also, you know the top three English speaking countries and the most suitable 
funding type for Teclov. Let’s call the three countries 'Country 1', 'Country 2' and 
'Country 3' and the funding type 'FT'. 
 
Also, the range of funding preferred by Teclov is 5 to 15 million USD. 
 
Now, the aim is to find out the most heavily invested main sectors in each of the 
three countries (for funding type FT and investments range of 5-15 M USD). 
1. Create three separate data frames D1, D2 and D3 for each of the three 
countries containing the observations of funding type FT falling within the 5-15 
million USD range. The three data frames should contain:
! All the columns of the master_frame along with the primary sector and the 
main sector
! The total number (or count) of investments for each main sector in a separate 
column
! The total amount invested in each main sector in a separate column
Using the three data frames, you can calculate the total number and amount of 
investments in each main sector. 
 Result Expected 
1. Three data frames D1, D2 and D3
2. Table 5.1: Based on the analysis of the sectors, which main sectors and 
countries would you recommend Teclov to invest in? Present your conclusions 
in the presentation. The conclusions are subjective (i.e. there may be no ‘one 
right answer’), but it should be based on the basic strategy — invest in sectors 
where most investments are occurring. 
 
Note: In the following table, all the observations refer to investments of the 
type FT within 5-15 M USD range. 
 
Table 5.1 : Sector-wise Investment Analysis 
 Country 1 Country 2 Country 3
 1. Total number of investments 
(count)
 2. Total amount of investment 
(USD)
 3. Top sector (based on count of 
investments) 
Problem 6: Plots 
As a final step, you have to present your findings to the CEO of Teclov. Specifically, 
she wants to see the following plots: 
 4. Second-best sector (based on 
count of investments)
 5. Third-best sector (based on 
count of investments)
 6. Number of investments in the 
top sector (refer to point 3)
 7. Number of investments in the 
second-best sector (refer to point 
4)
 8. Number of investments in the 
third-best sector (refer to point 5)
 9. For the top sector count-wise 
(point 3), which company received 
the highest investment?
 10. For the second-best sector 
count-wise (point 4), which 
company received the highest 
investment?
